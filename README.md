# msb_videolab
This repo contains all the scripts needed to run various algorithms for data cleaning, data alignment and other for Professor Uwe Altmann's lab at the Medical School Berlin.
Each folder contain either a Python or an R script to execute the process that is described in the README.md file of that repo.

## To start
Make sure you have downloaded git (choose all default suggestions) and (I suggest) VS Code.
Remeber to install a python environment if executing the python files.
Install python on your computer; open a new terminal (preferably the one in VS Code) and write `python -m venv msb`. This will create a new virtual environment titled msb. If you don't know what a virtual environment is, ask chatgpt or youtube it!
Then activate that environment by writing `.\env\Scripts\activate` and install the packages needed `pip install pandas numpy openpyxl pyyaml`.
